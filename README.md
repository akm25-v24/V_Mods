Voron 2.4 Exhaust Rear Cover with Carbon Pellet Filter Box

This is a drop-in replacement for the stock Voron 2.4 exhaust filter access cover that integrates a dedicated carbon-pellet filter box with a sliding door for tool-free pellet replacement.
Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Integrated Carbon Pellet Compartment
Holds loose activated carbon pellets (approximately 50 g), providing enhanced odor and VOC filtration beyond the standard foam filter.
	‚Ä¢	Sliding Access Door
A simple slide-in/out door mechanism lets you refill or replace the carbon pellets in seconds‚Äîno tools required.
	‚Ä¢	Drop-In Fit
Uses the exact mounting footprint and M3 screw holes of the original cover ([a] filter_access_cover.stl), so no modification of the Voron or fan shroud is needed.
	‚Ä¢	Compact & Lightweight
Maintains a slim profile. Recommended print settings: 0.20 mm layer height, 40 % infill, material‚ÄîABS/ASA for ease or Nylon for higher-temperature chambers.
